Use Peasy-p to make web games with practically zero programming!  Peasy-p is under construction by Donn Denman (from Google).

Peasy-p is planned to be an HTML5-based development environment for interactive games that run in the browser.  The design philosophy is to make it easy to find existing games and game components, and to modify them or reassemble them to create your own games with minimal effort.  This is facilitated through an integrated "watch" mode that allows you to view how particular objects operate during game execution.  Modifications can easily be made in place, so you can immediately see the results of your changes.  Your game setup is available to other peasy-p users, and can be deployed as a web game simply by distributing a URL to your creation.

The main goal is to provide tools that make creation easy.  This is best done by facilitating small, robust modifications to existing systems.  At the simplest level, this means just running a program, or setting options.  At the visual level, this may include skinning the images associated with objects.  Modifying the start state for a game is another level of customization.  Defining instances, and classes can be done at the Peasy-p language level.  The language has both a textual and graphical form.  There is a core peasy-p language that interprets textual peasy-p using JavaScript.  At the lowest level JavaScript primitives can be coded to plug in to the language, or the open-source runtime can be modified.
